This README.md will explain all my project highlights on Tableau.

I have been passionate about Tableau since I started learning Data Science at Binus University. Tableau is a really easy-to-use tool that can function to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards, analyze large datasets, and present insights in an informative way. With Tableau, I can easily create dynamic charts, maps, and visualizations with just drag-and-drops that allow users to explore data in-depth. Its drag-and-drop interface and extensive customization options make it ideal for both beginners and advanced data analysts.

**First Project: Car Price Dashboard**

The car price dataset contains columns like selling price, present price, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and year. I created 3 visualizations.

The first visualization is called "Car Selling Price". This is a bubble chart that provides information based on the size of each bubble and the color. The size of the bubble indicates the selling price. While the color of the bubble indicates the fuel type and seller type (See the legend for further information!).

The second visualization is called "price details". This is a stacked bar chart. The top chart is for present price and the bottom chart is for selling price. For each chart, the y-axis indicates the price, the x-axis indicates the fuel type and seller type, and the color indicates the transmission type.

The third visualization is called "Prive Over Time". I created a line chart to display the average of either present price (the color blue) or selling price (the color orange) each year. There are two charts where the one on the left is for dealer seller type and the one on the right is for individual seller type.

**Second Project: House Price Dashboard**

This house price dashboard is aimed to provide an interactive and insightful overview of property prices, helping users analyze trends, compare properties such as bedrooms, bathrooms, conditions, price ranges, and identify patterns across different categories. It is designed to support decision-making for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

The first visualization is called "House Price by Bedrooms and Bathrooms". This visualization is aimed to better understand the distribution of house price by the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

The second visualization is called "House Price Over Time". This visualization allows us to view the sum of house price over time based on the number of floors.

The third visualization (The Bubbles Chart One) can show us the sum of house price based on the condition and the number of floors.

The fourth visualization (Below The Bubbles Chart) functions to give us insight on the sum of house price based on the type of waterfront, the view, and the number of floors.
